# Anita Pizza

React.js-application, for the infamous (yet non-existent) Anita Pizza. Testing different animations and codepen-snippets, such as:
* 3-dimensional spinning Pizza, built with CSS only, based on this [Codepen](https://codepen.io/quadbaup/full/zXedRJ), from <strong>Grant</strong>
* Custom Pizza-creator, based on this [Codepen](https://codepen.io/aydenking30/pen/ezbjmm), from <strong>Ayden King</strong>
* A very ketchupy & juicy easteregg, instigated by the congenial [Duckmaster Max](https://github.com/MaxFilippo)

## Further techniques

* [<strong>LottiePlayer React</strong>](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lottiefiles/react-lottie-player)
